[{"content":"New Blog, who’s this?\nHello, I’m Jay and I spent the last year living in Japan. As a British person, I had access to the Working Holiday Visa Scheme, which allows a young person under the age of 30 the right to live and work in Japan with almost no restriction.\nOver this year, my partner and I decided to move every month. We wanted to see as much of Japan as we could, we didn’t want our year to be spent in an international share house in Tokyo. Over the year we lived and worked in: Tokyo, Okinawa, Miyazaki, Kyoto and Nagano. We spent festival seasons traveling around seeing autumn leaves, snow sculptures and cherry blossoms.\nI now have done the same again, moving to Taiwan. In our brief time back in the UK I found myself going over the same stories, realising that we’d done something quite amazing. I started writing a travel diary, which has now breached 100 pages. That’s long enough for me to start taking this seriously. I’ve made hundreds of vlogs over on my YouTube channel, keeping the memories fresh.\nI’m a software developer, so my thought process is this. If I am going to do something big, like write a book, then I need a way to see if anybody likes that idea before I finish it. So here we are. Welcome to the Land of the Rising Monkey. I am the Monkey. You are the reader.
